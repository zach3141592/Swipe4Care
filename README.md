# Swipe4Care 🏥❤️

A modern app to discover healthcare and clinical trial volunteer opportunities with an intuitive swipe interface. Built with React, Node.js, and powered by Google's Gemini AI for intelligent opportunity discovery.

## Features ✨

- **🔍 Smart Discovery**: AI-powered scraping of healthcare opportunities using Gemini API
- **👆 Intuitive Interface**: Swipe left to pass, swipe right to save opportunities
- **❤️ Save for Later**: Keep track of opportunities you're interested in
- **🎨 Modern Design**: Clean black and white UI optimized for mobile and desktop
- **📱 Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes

## Tech Stack 🛠️

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Styled Components (styling)
- Axios (HTTP client)

**Backend:**

- Node.js with Express
- SQLite (database)
- Google Gemini AI API
- CORS enabled

## Quick Start 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- The app comes pre-configured with a Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Swipe4Care
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Start the development servers** (API key already configured!)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) servers.

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the app!

   > ✅ **All issues fixed!** The app is fully functional with Gemini 1.5 Flash API and clean TypeScript compilation.

## How It Works 🔄

1. **Opportunity Discovery**: The app uses Gemini AI to generate and discover realistic healthcare and clinical trial opportunities
2. **Swipe Interface**: Users can swipe right to save opportunities they're interested in, or swipe left to pass
3. **Persistent Storage**: All interactions are saved to a local SQLite database
4. **View Saved**: Users can view all their liked opportunities with direct links to apply

## API Endpoints 📡

- `GET /api/opportunities` - Get unswiped opportunities for a user
- `POST /api/swipe` - Record a swipe interaction
- `POST /api/scrape` - Trigger discovery of new opportunities
- `GET /api/liked` - Get all liked opportunities for a user

## Security & Environment 🔒

The app is configured with a working Gemini API key for immediate use. The setup includes:

- `.env` - Contains the actual API key (excluded from Git)
- `.env.example` - Template file with placeholder values (included in Git)
- `.gitignore` - Ensures sensitive files stay local

If you want to use your own API key, simply edit the `.env` file.
